Problem Set 2
-------------

1.  Do the following problems from the end of Chapter 1 in _Analyzing Congress_.
    *   Problems 7, 8, 10 and 11
2.  The following figure shows the ideal points of a three-person legislature that is deciding on spending levels along two dimensions, Guns and Butter. The status quo (Ñ„) is also indicated.

Decisions are made using the following rules:

*   Motions are voted on one dimension at a time.
*   An agenda-setter makes a motion that is decided by the chamber on a take-it-or-leave-it basis (In other words, if the proposal is rejected by a majority vote, the game is over and the status quo prevails).
*   Decisions are made based on majority rule.

B1. Show the policy outcome if Member A is the agenda-setter on the Guns dimension and Member C is the agenda-setter on the Butter dimension.

B2. The answer for B1 will be a point in the policy space in the figure. Show the win set against the policy that results from answer B1.
